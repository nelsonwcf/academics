Exercise 13.6:

By running the three different algorithms on the same equation it was possible to see the performance difference in the algorithms.
Using the parameters provided by the book, parabolic interpolation had the least iterations, only 6, 22 from golden-ratio and also 6 from Newton. 
However, they can't be directly compared because the initial values were different. Parabolic interpolation however, even under the same brackets
as golden-ratio, it still uses only 7 iterations. Newton method, since it used only one initial value, it can't be directly compared.

Exercise 13.10:

While the exercise only asked to calculate the minimum by finding the root of diferentiated f, I tried to compare with the golden-ratio over the negative f and
the performance of the bisection was superior when using brackets of the same size (bisection 17 vs golden-ratio 23).
