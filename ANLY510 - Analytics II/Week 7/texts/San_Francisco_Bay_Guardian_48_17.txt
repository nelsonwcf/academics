GOOGLE GOOGLE,
BUS BLOCK

More than 100 protesters blocked
two more "Google buses" (one
reportedly actually bound for
Facebook, despite what has
become the generic label for the
private Silicon Valley shuttles)
near UN Plaza on the morning of
Jan. 21. The protest was part of
the run-upto an afternoon hearing
by the San Francisco Municipal
Transportation Administion on
the proposed $1 per stop fee,
which is supported by the tech
companies and Mayor Ed Lee but
opposed by many activists who say
it isn't enough to pay for the tech
industry's impacts to the housing
market, gentrification, and Muni.

SFMTA's decision, visit www. sfbg.

■ Screw it, tech will save us

■ Did we mention group shower
parties?

HOMELESS BILL
OF RIGHTS

The Western Regional Advocacy
Project and other organizations
that work with the homeless
used Martin Luther King Jr. Day
weekend to launch campaigns for
a Homeless Bill of Rights in both
California and Oregon, targeting
laws that ban sitting or sleeping
in public, includingaslewof such
laws in San Francisco in recent
years. Pledging peaceful resis-
tance, the groups quoted MLK as
their inspiration: "We will not obey
unjust laws or submit to unjust
practices. We will do this peace-
fully, openly, cheerfully because
ouraim is to persuade."

GARY EDSON

ARLINGTON,

1938-2014



Underground commix hero Gary
Arlington — who opened the
nation's first comic bookstore, San
Francisco Comic Book Company,
in 1968 in the Mission — passed
away at age 75. A true character
who galvanized the hotbed local
scene (which included R. Crumb,
Art Spiegelman, Jay Kinney, and
Trina Robbins), Arlington released
essential anthology series San
Francisco Comics m the 1980s
— and had released a book of his
colorful artwork, "I Am Not of
This Planet" (Last Gasp Press)
in 2012. Said Spiegelman, "San
Francisco was the capitol of comix
culture in the '60s and early '70s;
and Gary Arlington's hole-in-the-
wall shop was, for me, the capitol
of San Francisco." | photo by

LAST CHANCE LUCAS

After being soundly rejected by the
Presidio Trust last year, the final
round of project proposals for the
Crissy Field Presidio site are in,
and boy do they sure look... almost
exactly the same asthe last round.
OK, Star Wars creator George
Lucas' abysmal, mall-like subur-
ban Spanish Revival museum is uh,
smaller. That counts, right?



TORCHING
AN EVICTION
STRAW MAN

San Francisco Magazine may

have hit a new low in its regular
pro-landlord apologia when its
Editor Jon Steinberg tweeted
"We're calling BS on SF's eviction
crisis" on Jan. 20, linkingto an
article about the Ellis Act. It cher-
ry-picks data showing 117 Ellis
evictions for the year leading up to
last February, ignoring data on the
more recent uptick, on forced buy-
outs that use Ellis as leverage, and
other aspects of the eviction and
displacement crisis. And it never
even uses the words "rent control,"
which Ellis was designed to sub-
vert, creating a cumulative erosion
of the city's affordable rental stock
that began duringthe last dot-com
boom. Luckily, that straw man arti-
cle gottorched by the online flame
war that followed.



OBAMA SPIES NO MORE?



Well, not really. Friday Jan. 17, President Barack Obama put on his best
"gee whiz, I'm concerned" pouty face and announced lots of changes to
the NSA's massive spy-on-everybody
program: moving metadata to a third
party, increasing court requirements,
purging information on US citizens,
and requiring high level permission
tospy on foreign powers, to name
a few. Will the changes be enough
to make Americans feel secure
again? You don't need
to have the all seeing
powers of Edward
Snowden to know
that'slikely a no.

LOOKING AT 'LOOKING'



Much-hyped gay-themed HBO series Looking, set in San Francisco
and following a trio of hip, scruffy men (a naive videogame designer,
an artist who moves to Oakland, and a waiter experiencingthe glim-
mers of a midlife crisis) debuted on Sunday, Jan. 19. SF glows in the
half-hourshow, written by former resident Michael Lannan, but the
play-it-too-safe plotting has disappointed some viewers hoping for
something more reflective of the Bay Area's vibrant queer culture.
Still, we're looking forward to seeing where Lool<ing leads.

BY JASON HENDERSON

STREET FIGHT Much has been written
about the so-called "Google buses"
and San Francisco's latest round of
gentrification. It's a horrible mess
and the city's trifling $1 charge per
bus stop will do little to address
the broader structural problem that
these buses lay bare.

Ordinary people cannot ride
them, nor do the people who clean
and cook for the tech world. Like
tour buses, they are clunky and
inappropriate for many neigh-
borhood streets. While they do
substitute for some car trips, an
ad hoc private transit system does
not reflect the kind of thoughtful
regional planning needed to truly
reduce car use in the Bay Area.

But the controversy over the
private commuter buses does show
that there is great potential for a
public regional express bus system.
Consider that in 1980, 9 percent
of commuters in San Francisco left
the city every day to go to work.
In 2010, outbound commuters
approached 25 percent. Owing to
regional political fragmentation.
Muni cannot provide intercounty
service and thus is not the travel
mode of choice for many of these
commuters. And although Caltrain
and BART offer some regional
service, the sprawling locations of
suburban firms often make regional
rail impractical or at the very least
time-consuming owing to unavoid-
able multiple transfers to local buses.

So in noteworthy ways, the rise
of private transit is an immediate
reaction to poor regional transit
connections. Yet rather than side-
stepping failed regional planning
by encouraging an inequitable, two-
tiered, private system, we need to
expand and regionalize the existing
public bus systems. San Francisco's
mayor and Board of Supervisors
have seats at the table of regional
planning and ought to use the con-
troversy over private buses as an
opportunity to kickstart the imple-
mentation of a regional public bus
system accessible to all.

For example, something like AC
Transit's Transbay routes should be
extended through San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties, perhaps oper-
ated by BART or Caltrain as part of
the next iteration of Plan Bay Area.
This network would use reallocated



6 SAN FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN



express lanes on 101 and 1-280 and
use transit priority lanes on arterials
like 19th Avenue in San Francisco
and El Camino Real in San Mateo.
Regional property assessments on
the corporations and developers,
in part already possible within the
existing BART district (one should be
created for Caltrain), could be used
to fund such a system. Congestion
charging on 101 and 1-280 should
also be deployed and those funds
used for electrifying Caltrain and
developing the parallel and comple-
mentary regional bus system.

Of course there will be oppo-
sition to a regional public bus
system as there already is to pro-
gressive regional planning. Transit-
connected, walkable communities
in the South Bay, for example, have
been made all but illegal by decades
of conservative middle and upper
class, anti-density, anti-tax home-
owners in suburban localities. As
recently as last year, this Tea Party-
style conservative politics dampened
Plan Bay Area, resulting in a weak
regional housing plan with an
underfunded and lackluster transit
vision. This conservative approach
stifles our collective sense of what is
possible and the fear-mongering has
rendered regional planners virtually
impotent. Yet it can and must be
overcome.

Some progressives may find
it convenient (and in some cases
justifiable) to target tech workers
right now, but they could also
direct energy into shaping the next
round of Plan Bay Area. Remember
that Plan Bay Area is a living docu-
ment, a work in progress. The cur-
rent version of the plan, weak on
transit funding, has been subdued
by a loud, irrational mob of Tea
Party cranks bent on sabotaging
anything that hints of progressive
ideas. Plan Bay Area is also stifled
by a regional business class that
wants to keep the status quo and
that is comfortable with the neolib-
eral model of private transit.

So while a smattering of dedi-
cated and hard-working progressive
transit activists showed up and
attempted to shape Plan Bay Area
last year, in the coming years the
plan needs a broader progressive
movement — including transit,
housing, social justice, and envi-
ronmental activists — to demand
a more visionary regional trans-

portation plan that connects all
of the Bay Area. I am hopeful that
this would not only steer regional
planning in a progressive direction,
but many of the tech workers who
are now on the private buses would
gladly join in the cause.

THE POLITICS OF
SUNDAY PARKING

Speaking of hopeful, last month
the SFMTA reported that Sunday
metering, implemented last January,
is a resounding success. Switching-
on the meters doubled parking
availability on Sundays, which is
invariably what small businesses,
most of which are open on Sunday,
want to see.

Sunday meters increased the
number of cars using city-owned
garages and decreased the time cars
circled in search of parking from an
average of four minutes to two —
de-cluttering streets in commercial
districts. While this might seem
like a boon to drivers, it also means
less pollution, safer conditions for
pedestrians and cyclists, less delay
for Muni, and a much needed
enhancement of revenue for operat-
ing public transit.



GOOD TECH FOOD + DRINK



So it is mystifying that such
success would be ignored by Mayor
Ed Lee, who instead has proposed
to discontinue Sunday metering.
This is doubly confusing because,
based on existing travel behavior
to many commercial districts, 25
percent of people arrived by driv-
ing, while 31 percent took transit
and 25 percent walked. So what the
mayor is effectively saying to the
pedestrian and transit-using major-
ity is you matter little. What does
matter is the few whining motorists
who called him to complain about
being "nickel and dimed."

The mayor talks a good game
when saying he is truly concerned
about pedestrian and cyclist safety,
and insisting that he wants to fix
Muni. But gutting a reliable source
of operating funds and pandering
to car drivers who will dangerously
circle for parking is inconsistent.

Lee says money isn't an issue
because his proposed General
Obligation bond (which must be
approved by voters) will patch the
lost revenue from Sunday metering.
But the GO bond will incur further
debt and only fund existing capital
needs, while parking meters provide



a debt-free steady revenue stream
for Muni. It's also slightly mislead-
ing because the bond would not
cover Muni operations, while reve-
nue from Sunday metering does pay
for operations.

The mayor's pandering also
put the SFMTA Board of Directors,
which has been working out park-
ing management and Muni finance,
on the spot. Ultimately it has to
vote to preserve or scrap Sunday
metering in the coming months.
Now the directors have to decide
if they support transit-first or the
mayor's pandering.

Unfortunately, when it comes
to parking policy, the way that the
Board of Supervisors has behaved
lately suggests it will either jump on
the mayor's bandwagon and pander
to motorists or cower in silence as
good public policy is trashed. Not a
good situation at City Hall, where
transit riders seem to be routinely
thrown under the bus by the politi-
cal establishment, sfbg

More than 50 public comment-
ers spoke at the Jan. 16 joint
Police Commission and Board
of Supervisors committee meet-
ing, and all sounded one mes-
sage loud and clear: Drivers can
maim and kill pedestrians with
near impunity in San Francisco,
and that must end.

"I'm here very simply to
urge you to end the carnage on
our streets/' said Natalie Burdick
of the nonprofit Walk SF.

Pedestrian deaths reached
a high last year, with 21 killed
in traffic collisions. Sup. Eric
Mar criticized Mayor Ed Lee's
Pedestrian Strategy, which has
a funding gap of $5-18 million.
But SFPD's failure to cite motor-
ists was the main criticism.

"The fact is these statistics
have been consistent that two-
thirds of pedestrian accidents
are the fault of the driver," Sup.
Scott Wiener said. (Joe Fitzgerald)



O STATE OF THE CITY: SPIN OVER SUBSTANCE



It was maddening to watch Mayor
Ed Lee deliver his annual State of the
City address on Jan. 17. This was pure
politics, from the staged backdrop
of housing construction at Hunters
Point Shipyard to the use of "regular
people" props to the slate of vague
and contradictory promises he made.

"This place, the shipyard, links
our proud past to an even more prom- .
ising future," was how Lee began his
hour-plus, invite-only address.

Later, he touted the housing con-
struction being done there by Lennar
Urban as emblematic of both his
promise to bring 30,000 new housing
units online by 2020 — the corner-
stone to what he called his "afford-
ability agenda" — and the opposition
to unfettered development that he is
pledging to overcome.

"A great example is the place
we're standing right now. This took
us too long," Lee said after decrying
the "easy slogans and scapegoating"
by progressive activists who place
demands on developers.

But that implication was bull-
shit. As we've reported, progressive and



community activists have long encour-
aged Lennar Urban (which has a close
relationship to Lee) to speed up devel-
opment on this public land that it was
given almost a decade ago, particularly
the long-promised affordable housing,
rather than waiting for the real estate
market to heat up.




H@#PENED



1.15-1.21.2014.



That was just one of many
examples of misleading and unsup-
ported claims in the speech.

For example, Lee called for
greater investments in the public
transit system while acknowledging




that his proposal to ask voters this
November to increase the vehicle
license fee isn't polling well. And yet
even before that vote takes place, Lee
wants to extend free Muni for youth
and repeal the policy of charging for
parking meters on Sundays without
explaining how he'll pay for that $10
million per year proposal.

Lee also glossed over the fact
that he hasn't provided funding for
the SFMTA's severely underfunded
bicycle or pedestrian safety pro-
grams, yet he still said, "I support
the goals of Vision Zero to eliminate
traffic deaths in our city."

Again, nice sentiment, but one
disconnected from how he's choos-
ing to use city resources. And if Lee
can somehow achieve his huge new
housing development push. Muni and
other critical infrastructure will only
be pushed to the breaking point faster.

Even with his call to increase the
city's minimum wage — something
that "will lift thousands of people
out of poverty" — he shied away
from his previous suggestion that
$15 per hour would be appropriate



and said that he needed to consult
with the business community first:
"We'll seek consensus around a sig-
nificant minimum wage increase."

But Mayor Lee wants you to
focus on his words more than his
actions, including his identification
with renters who "worry that spec-
ulators looking to make a buck in a
hot market will force them out."

Yet there's little in his agenda
to protect those vulnerable renters,
except for his vague promise to try to
do so, and to go lobby in Sacramento
for reforms to the Ellis Act.

Lee also noted the "bone dry
winter" we're having and how, "It
reminds us that the threat of climate
change is real." Yet none of the pro-
grams he mentions for addressing
that challenge would be as effective
at reducing greenhouse gas emissions
as the CleanPowerSF program that
Lee and his appointees are blocking,
while offering no other plan for
building renewable energy capacity.

Far from trying to beef up local
public sector resources that vulner-
able populations increasingly need,
Lee said, "Affordability is also about
having a city government taxpayers
can afford." (Steven T. Jones)

Manhattanization revisited

Is more, taller, and denser housing the answer to SF's affordability crisis?



BY JOE FITZGERALD RODRIGUEZ

joe@sfbg.com

NEWS The housing crisis is spurring pro -development
arguments that threaten to hasten the "Manhattanization
of San Francisco/' a buzzphrase from another era that led
to local controls on high-rise development.

The city is getting richer and less diverse, and the
unaddressed displacement of longtime residents has
fueled populist outrage. Now, politicians are finally get-
ting the message, but some are offering solutions that may
reopen old civic wounds.

They say that the answer to the housing affordability
crisis is to build massive amounts of new housing, and to
build it higher and more densely than city codes and pro-
cesses currently allow.

Sup. Scott Wiener wrote a scathing indictment of the
city's alleged aversion to housing production in the San
Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 13, slamming a planning pro-
cess that he says slows necessary construction.

"This disconnect — saying that we
need more housing while arbitrarily
finding reasons to kill or water down
projects that provide that housing — is
having profound effects on our city
and its beautiful diversity, economic
and otherwise," Wiener wrote.

Though he mentioned affordable
housing, the need to build
all kinds of housing
was the crux of his
argument. It's the same
kind of developer-friendly
rhetoric that whips people into
a frenzy with faux common sense:
build more, and the market will take care of everyone.

But there are flaws to that simplistic argument.
Housing advocates (and Guardian editorials) have long
argued that market rate units — the median price of
which just surpassed $1 million — don't trickle down
to maintain the city's economic diversity. More supply
may help, but with insatiable demand for housing here, it
won't help much with affordability for the working class.

The next day, Wiener introduced legislation to loos-
en density requirements when developers build below-
market-rate housing units on site, creating an incentive
to build more of the units that affordable housing advo-
cates say are most valuable.

"Long term, I'm concerned about young persons
that can come here," he told the Guardian. "It's not just
about building more housing."

Pushing a pro-development agenda while playing
lip service to an affordable housing push is all the rage
in San Francisco nowadays, with Mayor Ed Lee calling
for building 30,000 new housing units by 2020, sup-
porting the rapid growth calls by SPUR, Housing Action
Coalition, and other pro-growth groups.

But Peter Cohen, co-director of the Council of
Community Housing Organizations, says supply and
demand logic doesn't apply to the San Francisco hous-
ing market for a number of reasons.

He pointed to a paper by CCHO cohort Calvin Welch,
who teaches a class on the politics of housing develop-
ment at USF and SFSU. Welch cites data from the City
Controller's Office showing that when San Francisco




increases supply, the market responds by raising the aver-
age housing price. Contrary to all the supply and demand
claims, when we produce more, things get more expensive.
Why?

"In classic economic theory prices are set by supply
and demand only when the market is 'competitive'
when neither consumers nor suppliers have the 'market
power' to set the price by themselves," Welch wrote.
"Clearly, that is not the case in San Francisco."

"There is no 'free land' in San Francisco," he wrote.
"The owners have total 'market power' over its price."

But that's the kind of complex argument has a tough
time penetrating the public consciousness. The idea isn't
as catchy as "supply and demand."

"I think frankly this whole thing about build, build,
build — it's an easy answer to something that's complex,"
Cohen told us. "It resonates. It sounds like the easy path
to sound like you know what you're talking about."

That simplistic thinking is dangerous, though, because
San Francisco is quickly becoming Manhattanized.
Since 2002, New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg rezoned over 37 percent of
New York City, according to The New York
Times, causing the construction frenzy
many are seeking for SF.

Bloomberg added 40,000 buildings
in his time as mayor, but that boom
had mixed results. It arguably
hastened the Big Apple's
gentrification, especial-
ly in Manhattan, one
of the few US cities denser
than San Francisco.
From 2000 to 2010,
Manhattan's ranks of white people swelled by
58,000. During the same period, the wealthy home of Wall
Street lost 29,000 African Americans and 14,000 Latinos.
More alarming is the income disparity there.

From 1990 to 2010, the city that never sleeps
increasingly became a city of have and have-nots.
Census maps showed that while 1990 Manhattan had
economic diversity, now the median income hovers over
$75,000 for most blocks of that famous borough.

Articles from the Times and NYC-based housing
advocacy organizations frequently describe Manhattan
as a haven of wealthy white yuppies. Sound familiar?

San Francisco is quickly following suit. The same
census maps that show the swell of wealth in Manhattan
show a swell of wealthy folk in San Francisco.

BMR housing set-asides help, and Mayor Lee has
promised to ramp up BMR production, calling for about
10,000 units by the year 2020. But any serious increase
in housing production carries its own cost in a city where
public transit and other vital infrastructure are already
underfunded and would need serious new investments.

In his Jan. 17 State of the City speech. Mayor Lee
warned against demonizing the tech industry or with
pitting one group against another. "San Francisco
changes us more than any group of newcomers will
change San Francisco," he said to the invite-only crowd.

"Manhattanization" is not just a buzz term or a scare
tactic: It's representative of a specific set of zoning and
construction policies that many San Franciscans are now
advocating for, which will change the demographics and
politics of this city, whether we like it or not. sfbg

Tenant battle brewing

Housing activists, politicians push parallel reform agendas



BY REBECCA BOWE

rebecca@sfbg.com

NEWS Benito Santiago, 63, was born
and raised in San Francisco. But
now that he's received an eviction
notice from the apartment he's lived
in since 1977, he isn't sure what the
future holds.

"This is roots for me," Santiago
told us. "I have more affinity for San
Francisco than the Philippines," his
family's place of origin.

He works part-time with disabled
youth enrolled in San Francisco
public schools. "The idea that I built
a rapport with these students here
... to be put in a position where I
wouldn't be able to work with them,
I'm a little saddened and depressed
by it," he said. "If I'm homeless, I
can't be taking care of these kids. I
mean — it's a worst-case scenario."

He's been exploring alternative
housing options, and trying to stay
positive. He says he's even trying to
"change the rate of vibration" of the
real estate speculators seeking to oust
him as part of his pre-dawn medita-
tion and ritualistic movement prac-
tice, a routine he developed to miti-
gate the chronic pain he dealt with
after being hit by an automobile when
he was crossing the street in 1980.

"Hopefully, they can have some
compassion," he said.

Santiago is hoping to get a tem-
porary extension to stave off his
eviction, and he's been looking into
publicly subsidized below-market rate
apartments. But rent for even the most
affordable of those places would eat up
75 percent of his monthly income, he
said. Unless he can find an affordable
arrangement somewhere, he might
end up having to leave the city.

GROWING MOVEMENT

Santiago has been a part of a growing
movement underway in San Francisco
to reform the Ellis Act and introduce
meaningful legislation at the local
level to protect the city's renters.

In recent weeks, the San
Francisco Anti Displacement



Coalition, made up of a wide range
of organizations including the San
Francisco Tenants Union, has host-
ed a series of neighborhood tenant
conventions to solicit ideas that
will be boiled down at a citywide
tenants' gathering scheduled for Feb.
8. At that meeting, organizers plan
to hash out a strategy and possibly
solicit ideas for a ballot initiative.

The tenant conventions are hap-
pening on a parallel track with efforts
to reform the Ellis Act, which allows
landlords to remove apartments from
the rental market and evict tenants.

"Our goal is to ban the use of the
Ellis Act in certain circumstances,"
explained Dean Preston of Tenants
Together, a nonprofit focused on
strengthening the rights of renters.

"More than half of Ellis Acts are
performed by people who bought the
properties within the past six months,"
he told us. "Their whole purpose is to
buy it and kick everyone out. It was
supposed to be for long-term landlords
to get out of the business" of being
landlords, he added. Instead, "it's
being completely abused."

Sen. Mark Leno is working with
Mayor Ed Lee on a response that
would seek to lessen the impact the
Ellis Act has had in San Francisco.
Meanwhile, Assemblymember Tom
Ammiano is spearheading a separate
effort.

"At this time, he's not really
ready to say which avenue he's tak-
ing" in terms of a legislative strat-
egy, said Carlos Alcala, Ammiano's
communications director. "Because
that can rule out that avenue."

Preston said he's been through
waves of evictions before, but the
organizing now taking place has
been especially effective at drawing
attention to the issue. Oftentimes,
"the speculators are not from within
the city or even within the state," he
pointed out. "That has fueled a lot
of activism and courage."

For Santiago, the organizing has
given him heart during a difficult
time. "I'm hearing a lot of sad stories,"
he said, "and I am not alone." sfbg

Toward a more holistic
integration of technology
into Bay Area life



BY MARKE B.

marke@sfbg.com

Like Tabasco sauce, Lady Gaga,
and the color teal, technology in
itself is neither good nor bad — it's
all in how you use it. (Indeed, you
could argue that those first three
examples are technological feats in
their own right: Just don't use too
much, please!) And while battles
rightly rage about how the Bay
Area's tech industry is reweaving our
social fabric, creating and applying
technology is an art in itself, albeit
one that can have huge economic
and political impact.

It can be difficult to see past the
whizbang gizmos, marketing dazzle,
and glowing dollar signs of how
technology is normally presented
to us. But in this issue we wanted
to take a deeper look at some of
the ways technology is impacting
or enhancing Bay Area life, and
highlight some of its possibilities
in addressing some of the city's
real problems (no, not parking or
hailing a cab). For all the talk about
sharing economies and communal
interaction, there's still a huge gulf
between what's considered "innova-
tion" and what actually offers a path
toward civic solutions.

Important questions still hang
in the air (beyond the environmen-
tal and labor impacts of manufac-
turing such technologies): How can
innovation be better applied to help
city infrastructure and social ser-
vices? How can we integrate startup
energy into city policy-making and
government transparency? Can the
effects of "disruption" be assessed
using other indicators beyond mar-
ket value? In what ways can we
ameliorate the knee-jerk resistance
to innovation from all sides when it
comes to addressing the explosion
of homelessness, hunger, and child
poverty in the Bay Area? Can we
develop new "inputs" or ways of
including all Bay Area voices in the
conversation about how technology
is transforming the way we live?

And why can't we Kickstart
Muni, anyway?



Lately, there's been some move-
ment toward addressing some of
these concerns, especially when it
comes to art and culture. The huge,
forthcoming 5M project on Mission
plans to not only house Yahoo, but
also Intersection for the Arts and
SF Made, explicitly integrating local
arts and businesses into the startup
incubator template. A recent forum
hosted by music app WillCall on
how tech can better support the
local music and nightlife industry
packed the Public Works nightclub.
Proposals to help teach more coding
in schools and make government
more transparent are gaining steam.

Of course, it's always wise to
maintain a healthy skepticism about
the latest shiny thing, and to realize
the limits of technology — often it
can't even clean up its own mess —
and especially the people behind it.
But it's also important to keep push-
ing the conversation about technol-
ogy's role in civic engagement for-
ward in positive, thought-provoking,
even spicy new directions, sfbg

Government with tech has
possibilities and pitfalls



BY REBECCA BOWE

rebecca@sfbg.com

A growing number of people seem
to be convinced that "civic inno-
vation" is sexy.

Tech- oriented events at San
Francisco City Hall, like hackathons
for improving government services,
have become increasingly common.
App developers are gaga over the
idea of revolutionizing government
through software, and the concept is
gaining momentum.

To borrow an analogy referenced
in an essay by tech publisher Tim
O'Reilly, some software purveyors
are moving away from the idea of
government as a vending machine:
"When we don't get what we expect,
our 'participation' is limited to pro-
test — essentially, shaking the vend-
ing machine."

Instead, they're latching onto the
idea of government as an open plat-
form that citizens can tinker with.

That's exciting. Can it lead to a
government that is more responsive



to the people, as enthusiasts predict?
Can we really hack away the inef-
fective and irresponsive parts of the
public sector?

Or is some of this just hype
and libertarian idealism from a
cash-drenched tech sector seeking
business opportunities and greater
political influence?

HACK THE LAW

Sup. Mark Farrell recently proposed
doing away with an outmoded and
widely disregarded law disallow-
ing bicycle storage in garages. The
legislative tweak matters because
it was spurred by feedback sub-
mitted through a new website,
SanFranciscoCode.org.

Operated by a private nonprofit
organization called the OpenGov
Foundation, the website presents
an interactive, online version of the
city's municipal code with an open
platform where anyone can easily
comb through the thicket of city
laws and leave comments on specific
sections, using the software as a
magnifying glass.

Farrell touted the website —
launched in partnership with Mayor
Ed Lee's Office of Civic Innovation
last September — as a tool that
could spur "a more transparent and

engagement," said Jess Montejano,
Farrell's legislative aide. Seamus
Kraft, executive director of the
OpenGov Foundation, has been
compiling all the comments sub-
mitted via SanFranciscoCode.org,
and recently sent a memo with all
user feedback to each member of the
Board of Supervisors.

"Our mission is to put as much
public information into the public's
hands as possible," Kraft said, "so
that people can access their laws the
way they deserve in 2013."

The idea that a law would be
changed instantly based on public
comments is a new take on an old
concept, with shades of being enam-
ored by that shiny new thing. After
all, many supervisors have a habit of
turning their backs, or very obviously
zoning out, during public comment
sessions at weekly board meetings.

Yet anyone with an Internet
connection can run with this new
portal for citizen engagement. How
about a reinvigorated response to
San Francisco's Sit/Lie Ordinance? A
torrent of online commentary about
the public nudity ban? Not every-
one has the same idea about what it
means to fix a broken law.

In some respects. City Hall
appears to be lending itself out as
a laboratory in which to test the
wide-ranging theories of civic inno-
vators. Mayor Lee has greeted the
technology sector with arms wide
open, and empowered the Office of
Civic Innovation to foster tech-fu-
eled government fine-tuning.

With the rise of amply fund-
ed organizations such as Code for
America, droves of programmers stand
at the ready, eager to chip in and do
their part to help transport the public
sector out of the analog ages.

A recent brigade of Code for
America fellows partnered with
the city's Department Health and
Human Services to create an app
that automatically notifies food
stamp recipients via text when they
are about to be automatically dis- en-
rolled. The idea is to give recipients
advance notice so they can take
steps to renew their enrollment.

Other initiatives, such as the
Department of Public Health's
release of an open data set to reveal
housing inspection records, can arm
citizens with useful knowledge —
like empowering apartment hunters
to spot a slumlord from a mile away.

The use of tech for transparency
holds potential: What if each and
every public record — down to
every last email, calendar appoint-
ment, or police report — were



instantly uploaded to a publicly
accessible database, easy to locate,
and fully searchable? Would that be
a check against corruption?

Ron Bouganim, a San Francisco -
based venture capitalist and men-
tor to the very Code for America
teams industriously improving
city government through tech-
nology, recently filed paperwork
with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to create GovTech. It's
a new kind of venture capital fund,
specifically devoted to fostering
companies looking to find their way
in the "civic innovation" sector.

Bouganim laid out the dynamics
driving the civic innovation trend:
First, "2008-2009 was like a nuclear
bomb," he explained. "The financial
crisis was a cataclysmic event. The
money is not coming back, ever."

THE NEW NORMAL?

This new normal, characterized by
dramatically depleted public-sector
finances, has helped make government
more open to working with startups
instead of trusted brands like IBM,
Bouganim said, since startups can help
government "do more with less."

Bouganim also said adoption of
cloud computing has changed the
game. Whereas governments were
initially hesitant to move their data
to the cloud, the recent migration
has made it possible for companies
seeking government contracts to
price below the "procurement thresh-
old," a price point that triggers a
long public approval process before
a purchase can go through. Now
that technology has helped software
developers slice through red tape,
startups are flooding in, eager to land
public sector contracts.

The city's Entrepreneurship in
Residence webpage (entrepreneur.
sfgov.org), which markets a program
rolled out by the Office of Civic
Innovation, says it all. Sporting a
gleaming picture of San Francisco
City Hall, it bears the caption:
"Develop products & services for the
$142 billion public sector market."

Bouganim wasn't willing to say
much in the way of GovTech's plans,
but he mentioned that his accelerator
provides mentorship for startups that
are paired with government agencies,
and hinted that his initial invest-
ments would lead to "a dramatic
impact on government savings."

An underlying goal of the
whole civic innovation movement,
Bouganim added, "is to fundamen-
tally change this concept that gov-
ernment is over there, and I am over
here. We the people are the govern-

no such compunction. The Bay

Death and
Facebook

^^ocial media's important
O role during tragedies



BY STEVEN T.JONES

steve@sfbg.com

My appreciation for Facebook had
been waning in recent years.
Although I still use it almost every
day — mostly as a storehouse for
digital photos and events listings
or as a procrastination tool — I was
becoming turned off by its increas-
ing commercialization and ubiquity.

But last month, my eyes were
opened to the important role that
social media sites can play in our
lives, particularly Facebook, because
of how many people are on it: local
friends and acquaintances, extend-
ed family, people I grew up with or
knew in other places I've lived, and
friends of my friends and loved ones.

My girlfriend, Rhonda Barzon,
suddenly slipped into a coma on the
afternoon of Dec. 1, the result of pres-
sure in her brain that had caused a
severe headache and nausea, trigger-
ing our early morning trip to the hos-
pital. The next day, doctors conclud-
ed she was brain dead and we shut off
the ventilator the following day.

I'm still in shock over her death,
but the support that 1 and her family
received through Facebook has been
a huge source of comfort and con-
nection. Our ability to communicate
what was happening with Rhonda was
made easier and more far-reaching
through the use of Facebook, eliminat-
ing many of the countless phone calls
we would otherwise have had to make
during those difficult days.

People were profoundly affected
by Rhonda's unexpected death, both
people who knew her well and those
who just followed our storybook
romantic rise from afar, including
people from our extended commu-
nity, her family, and those she knew
from previous phases of her life.

As the unfolding news of her
condition trickled out in Facebook
updates and comments, people were
able to look at photos and posts from
our charmed eight-month relation-
ship and see just how happy we were.
It helped that Rhonda was such a
luminous woman with an amazing
smile, but I heard again and again
from people how truly happy she
seemed. And she was, which turned
out to be one silver lining in this
tragic story, one reinforced by this
online record of our life together.

The breadth of the emotional
impact of Rhonda's unexpected
death and its amplification by
Facebook was epitomized a week
later by the woman who stopped me
on the street in my neighborhood
and told me, 'T'd really like to give
you a hug because I know who you
are and I know what happened."

It was a sweet, touching moment
that augmented the support that
I was getting from my immediate
physical community.

I understand and even share
the concerns that people have about
Facebook and other online realms,
which can offer the illusion of com-
munity connection while actually
feeding our sense of isolation. It can
make us more narcissistic and self-ab-
sorbed, a concern 1 even raised with
Rhonda a week before she died, asking



whether we were posting too many
lovey photos of ourselves on Facebook.

Now, I'm just happy that we did.
For good or ill, our lives and her death
played out in vivid fashion before
thousands of people in real time,
something that has immortalized this
tragedy and the amazing woman at the
center of it. And it has given me solace
for which I'll always be grateful, from
the hundreds of simple statements of
support through Facebook comments
to long, deeply personal messages pri-
vately delivered to me to hugs on the
street from random strangers.



Thank you all, and thank you,

BY REBECCA BOWE

rebecca@sfbg.com

The SF Bay Guardian newsroom is
tapping some high-tech tools to
continue its journalistic mission.

Working in partnership with a
group of technologists who dislike
government corruption just as much
as we do, we're launching a new
web-based system to enable sources
to anonymously submit documents
directly to our news staff.

The system offers better safeguards
for protecting sources' identities than
conventional email can offer.

Powered by a software system
called SecureDrop, the system is
designed to protect the identities
of whistleblowers if they wish to
share information without fear of
retaliation.

If the documents we receive con-
tain newsworthy information that
can be independently verified, weTl
use it as the basis for our reporting.

Since this is an experiment, we
have no idea what will land in our
SecureDrop folder — but it creates
the potential for us to partner with
sources in breaking significant
news items.

The SecureDrop program orig-
inated with the late Aaron Swartz,



who developed it in collaboration
with Wired Editor Kevin Poulson.
Swartz was an Internet activist and
programmer known for hashing
out inventive ways to fight corrup-
tion and promote transparency.
He's remembered, among other
things, for cofounding Reddit, the
online news site; and for found-
ing Demand Progress, an online
activism group known for its 2012
campaign against the Stop Online
Piracy Act.

Now, SecureDrop is man-
aged by the Freedom of the Press
Foundation, a nonprofit organi-
zation founded in 2012 that is
''dedicated to helping support and
defend public-interest journalism
focused on exposing mismanage-
ment, corruption, and law-breaking
in government."

Files submitted to the Guardian
through the SecureDrop system
will remain encrypted until they
are securely downloaded. This
means there's no way for a third
party to view their contents and
trace them back to the sender.

Sources' actual identities will
never be revealed, and they'll be
identified to our news staff only
through randomly generated code
names.

Of course, whistleblowers
desiring to keep their identities
unknown always have the option
of putting some documents into an
unmarked envelope and dropping
it in the mail.

But by submitting documents
through SecureDrop, sources will
have the ability to send high vol-
umes of information that would
be logistically difficult to print out
or send. The program also enables
sources to communicate with jour-
nalists in real time without reveal-
ing their actual identities.

Stay tuned. In coming weeks,
the Guardian will publish a clip-
out guide with instructions on how
to submit documents to our news
staff using SecureDrop. Sending
encrypted files to journalists begins
with downloading the Tor Browser
Bundle, a system that makes online
activity invisible to third parties, sfbg



Judging A
hackers ^

Social Good Hackathon
wants nerds, Luddites...
and even the Guardian



BY JOE FITZGERALD RODRIGUEZ

joe@sfbg.com

The Bay Guardian is happy to
announce a partnership with
BeMyApp, CloudCamp, Hewlett
Packard, and Intel in launching a
hackathon for societal benefit. I
will be one of the judges of their
CloudCamp Social Good Hackathon
the weekend of Jan. 24.

The hackathon is a contest
tasking programmers and design-
ers with creating apps that could



change their city, state, country, or
the world. Teams will craft those
changes around health, fitness, the
environment, and education. The
Guardian has always been solutions
based, and we hope to work with
tech to help solve the problems of
San Francisco's rising displacement
and inequality together.

Entrance in the hackathon is
free, though space is limited. The
first and second prizes are $5,000
and $4,000, respectively. Hackers
will strut their ones and zeroes at
Impact Hub San Francisco, which is
housed in the bottom floor of the
San Francisco Chronicle Building on
Fifth and Mission.

Kalina Machlis, community
manager at BeMyApp, said the
Guardian was a natural choice to
partner with them due to our often
critical stance on the tech commu-
nity: We'd keep them honest. She
also hoped it would help build ties
with a media community that can
be critical of the tech industry.

"It's a good way for you to see
there are positive things happening
in the tech world," she told us.

And though no one app can
solve all of San Francisco's social
ills, we hope this can be a first step
toward harnessing tech for the good
of all the city's residents.

Be advised, you don't necessarily
need to be a tech head to join in.
Just bring your ideas, Machlis told
us. "Our initial idea for beginning
the company was to bring together
people who don't have technical
skills with people who design and
code," she said.

We're looking forward to bring-
ing a bit of Guardian fire to a hub
of techies who want to change the
world. For every Greg Gopman
spewing hatred, no doubt there are
tech-savvy folk who care about the
less fortunate around them. We
want to meet those socially con-
scious hackers, sfbg

BALLIN' ON A BUDGET

This week features some smaller
openings around town, plus new
places to go for brunch, and, how
charming, they're not all gonna
leave you broke. Besides, some of
us self-employed types are still
reeling from those pesky tax quar-
terlies that were just due, blergh.

Pizza-man-about-town Jeff
Krupman (aka the PizzaHacker,
known for his FrankenWeber
mobile pizza oven) has pulled it
on over and has been softly open-
ing his first brick-and-mortar spot
in La Lengua-Bernal, aptly named
PizzaHacker (3299 Mission, SF.
www.thepizzahacker.com). He's
keeping the menu pared down,
with pies like a classic margherita,
although some have fun names
and ingredient combos like the
Yo Vinny (with marinated onions.
Mama LiPs pickled goat horn



peppers, 4505 hot Italian sausage,
tomato sauce, mozzarella), and
the Rocket Man (arugula, garlic,
mozzarella, farm egg, lemon juice,
chili paste).

For now, pizzas are $15
during the opening weeks — but
the pricing may change a bit in
the future, just FYI. There's also
a killer salad, check it out. The
space is pretty bare bones, with
seating at picnic tables or the
bar. Yay, there's local beer and
wine too. It's mostly open Thu-
Sun at 5:30pm, but check out
the schedule on the website or
on Twitter (@pizzahacker) before
heading over.

Downtown workers have
a couple new options to add
to their lunchtime mix, or for
post-work dinnertime. It's OK,
we know your fridge is empty.
First up. Bun Mee (650 Market, SF.
www.bunmee.co) has opened a
second location, with the same
menu as the original location
on Fillmore. You can order
Vietnamese sandwiches (you have
to try the sloppy bun, trust, and
get an egg on it!), along with

salads, and other items that are
good for eating at your desk, like
rice and noodle bowls. And get a
coconut sandwich cookie, because
hey, you're worth it. Open daily
10:30am-9pm.

There's no denying that the
burgers at Super Duper are pretty
fricking good — it's all about the
double patty action on the Super
burger. You now have another
location to hit up: The latest loca-
tion to open is in the Financial
District at 98 Mission (www.



superdupersf.com). Hours are
Mon-Fri 7am-8pm and Sat-Sun
llam-6pm.

You dig brunch? You're a San
Franciscan, of course you do. One
new brunch service that was just
added to our scene is on Saturdays
at St. Vincent (1270 Valencia, SF.
www.stvincentsf.com) in the
Mission. Come by noon-3pm for
an East Coast fave like scrapple
with fried eggs, or a new-fangled
rye waffle with mixed winter cit-
rus, pecans, hickory syrup, and



sour cream. Also very au courant
SF: a variety of toast toppings on
country bread, like cultured but-
ter with persimmon jam. Oysters
on the half shell, yep. And more
wine and tasty beers than you'd
know what to do with! Start with
some coffee from Bicycle Coffee
Co., however. Pace yourself.

Also in the Mission: the
folks at Hi Lo (3416 19th St., SF.
www.hilobbqsf.com) are serving
Sunday brunch (llam-2:30pm),
and this menu is not gonna let



you be hungry for long. You'll
find some Southern-inspired
numbers, like shrimp and grits

a jerked Bloody Mary with pork



fat-washed rye, Caribbean and

to, and Youk's hot sauce. Dude.
There are also three ''hair of the

O JD WILKES AND
THE DIRT DAUBERS

As the wild frontman for The
Legendary Shack Shakers, Col. J.D.
Wilkes brought together a wide array
of blues-infused and swampy sound-
ing rock 'n' roll, earning them the
admiration of fans and invitations
to tour with noted performers such
as Robert Plant. Wilkes — a bonafide




Kentucky colonel, hence his title —
formed The Dirt Daubers in 2009
with his wife, Jessica, and added gui-
tarist Rod Hamdallah and drummer
Preston Corn for the band's most
recent album. Wild Moon (Plowboy
Records). Produced by iconic punk
rocker Cheetah Chrome (The Dead
Boys), the album finds them back
in the vein of mixing traditional
sounds with an infectious rock atti-
tude and approach. (Sean McCourt)

O SWEAT LODGE

Spend a minimal amount of time on
the stretch of Mission between El Rio
and The Knockout, and youTl prob-
ably hear of these lo-fi punks. Not
simply since one member is a fixture
at the former bar, cooking up Indian
tacos and sweet frybread on the back
patio. No, it's because Sweat Lodge
seems to be a favorite of discerning
music aficionados and drunkards
alike. The last unprompted recom-
mendation came from a guy who
had literally just picked himself off
the sidewalk (his back hurt) and said,
'That dude's band fucking rocks" as
Rocky passed. Perhaps sensing jaded
skepticism he added, ''and I don't
give praise lightly." But I've checked
the tumblr and the tapes, and can't
disagree. (Ryan Prendiville)

O DAVE ALVIN

First displaying his formidable guitar
chops as a member of The Blasters
in the early 1980s, singer/songwriter
Dave Alvin has also played with
X and The Knitters, and has gone
on to a distinguished solo career,
with his most recent record. Eleven
Eleven (Yep Roc) coming out in 2011.
Hailing from the working class town



of Downey, the Grammy Award-
winning Alvin absorbed a host of
musical influences growing up, and
his soulful songwriting exudes the
best of that Americana and roots-
based music — he comes to the
city tonight for a special acoustic
show with Nina Gerber and Christy
McWilson. (Sean McCourt)

O DENT MAY

Over three albums. Dent May has
been a bit of a indie pop chameleon.
Take the fabulous lounge kitsch
of The Good Feeling Music Of Dent
May & His Magnificent Ukulele. Or
the drum machine disco revival on
Do Things. And May's latest. Warm
Blanket, is predictably unpredictable:
see the Bowie styled "Let's Dance"




Intro that quickly upshifts into an
afrobeat groove on "Let Them Talk."
Still, one thing May shares with his
label bosses Animal Collective is a
shared affinity for Brian Wilson, and
it's the biggest referent, with a track
like "Corner Piece" sounding like it
could have spun off of Pet Sounds,
and it's the perfect opportunity for
May to get increasingly open-heart-
ed and romantic. (Ryan Prendiville)

O FRANCESCA
LOMBARDO AT HEART
PHOENIX'S HIGHER

Sometimes it feels like watching
reruns. The one where the DJs idle
behind the decks, doing their best
to seem effortlessly cool, making
adjustments with a cigarette in
hand (and another drooping from
their bottom lip). Worse than
than that, the occasional amped
up excitement, hiding the fact
that the webcast probably won't
translate 100 percent, and in any



case, the scenester crowd will look
bored. Francesca Lombardo's recent
Boiler Room run avoided both pit-
falls. Centered around her vocals,
and orchestrated with strings,
Lombardo's music took a middle
path through deep house — some-
where between Maya Jane Coles and
Nicolas Jaar — confident but with
enough of a nervy edge befitting her
recent addition to Crosstown Rebels.

O JESSY LANZA

We've seen a major resurgence of
UK R&B-circa-'89 over the past
few years, but while songstresses
like Jessie Ware tackle those Lisa
Stansfield-ish stylings with showy
emotivity, Canada's Jessy Lanza
takes a borderline-shoegazer's
approach to her vocals, filtering
ambiguous yearnings and half-con-
fessions through delay and echo
until they're just another instru-
ment in the mix, as stark and
percussive as they are ethereal and
melodic. Released on the much-fe-
tishized Hyperdub imprint, and
produced/co-written by Junior
Boys' Jeremy Greenspan, Lanza's
icy, prickly, spacious debut LP, Pull
My Hair Back (2013), updates a
flashy throwback genre for intro-
verted, LCD -immersed times, in
which the people can't quite be
trusted to say what they mean,
or vice versa. This Saturday's
Popscene-curated show marks
Lanza's second-ever West Coast
appearance, and might elucidate
a persona that, similarly to those
of labelmates Hype Williams and
Laurel Halo, remains well con-
cealed. (Taylor Kaplan)

# AN EVENING
WITH MIKE MILLS

History, says artist Mike Mills,
inspired his three-part Project Los
Altos. But the past isn't all that
Mills is getting at — our present and
future make up history before they
happen, and currently, technology
is happening. This Sunday at the
Roxie, Mills gives a Q&A on the
'Tuture" third of his piece, a doc-
umentary entitled A Mind Forever
Voyaging Through Strange Seas of
Thought Alone: Silicon Valley Project
(2013). The film interviews chil-
dren of tech industry workers about




their predictions of the future. It's
dark, even spooky, to hear this
envisioned world, which has less
intelligence and fewer plants and
animals, because ultimately, the
children's imaginations reflect a
world we don't realize we might
already be living in. (Kaylen Baker)

Drum kits are not allowed, but
light percussion is fine, and the

O ROBERT DELONG

How do you gauge the frequently
overreaching world of one-man
bands, when pushing multitask-
ing to its limit is part of the draw?
Seemingly taking compulsive
loopster Merrill Garbus' cue (and
facepaint), Robert DeLong is a
live-sampling and track-layering
singer with an alternative pop
bent, as likely to switch over
to drums as he is to a modified
Wii-mote or Sidewinder joystick
in his performances. It's an
approach that puts him
at least in distinctive
territory: Neither
the minimalist
and, despite all
the effort, not
quite a maximal-
ist, DeLong is
more likely to get
featured in Wired
than written up
on Pitchfork,
and doesn't quite
fit into the EDM
arena, where going
alone is more
ordinary. At the
moment he seems to
be orbiting in a little
world of his own. (Ryan
Prendiville)

LEFT OF THE DIAL When MTV debuted
"Video Killed the Radio Star" at
12:01am on Aug. 1, 1981 — the first
music video to air on the brand-new,
much-buzzed-about network — pro-
ducers knew exactly what they were
doing. Amid all the excitement about
the possibilities video technology
presented to the music industry there
was an ambivalence, tinged with
apprehension from musicians, about
what the sea change would mean for
artists. The song perfectly captured
the current climate, a combination of
brave-new-world optimism and flat-
out fear of the future.

Two decades later, a scrappy little
Redwood City-based file-sharing start-
up called Napster would be ordered
shut down in federal court. 'Tt's time
for Napster to stand down and build
their business the old-fashioned way
— they must get permission first,"
said Hilary Rosen, president of the
Recording Industry Association of
America, told the New York Times,
speaking on behalf of five major
record labels that sued the company.
And, as everyone knows, that sealed
it: Music was never obtained for free
on the Internet ever again, all artists
were paid fairly for their work, and
everyone lived happily ever after.

Funny thing about technological
advancement — it only goes one way.
The collapse of the record industry
over the past decade has given way to
a sort of Wild West atmosphere when
it comes to the ways musicians, fans,
producers, etc. can interact, make
art, and do commerce. It has been
something of an economic equalizer:
Anyone with a Wi-Fi connection can
throw his latest dubstep/witchhouse
cover of "Under the Sea" up on
Soundcloud one night, and wake up
to a bevy of fans. But most musicians
I know would agree that the availabil-
ity of free or very cheap streaming
and downloading services has made
it difficult, if not impossible, to make
a living from their work the way they
might have 30 years ago.

And yet: There are those who
would argue that the tech world
has more to offer musicians than it
might initially seem. In the spirit
of our "good tech" issue, I reached
out to some local techies who aren't
using their powers for evil.

On the vast playing field of
websites and apps that promise to
help musicians get their work out
into the world — without, ideally,
anyone going bankrupt — Bandcamp
may have built the most trust among
artists, using a straightforward reve-




The"goqrdprtuhes



of musib tech



nue-share model: The company
takes 15 percent of sales on
digital purchases; 10 percent
on merch. Of course, it didn't
hurt when Amanda Palmer
decided to forego the tradi
tional album-release route
in 2010, releasing her
ukulele Radiohead
covers album solely on
Bandcamp, bringing in
$15,000 inside three minutes.

When founder Ethan Diamond
launched the site in 2007 — after
trying to buy a favorite band's digital
album directly from its website and
having "every single technical prob-
lem that could go wrong, go wrong"
— people were saying "music sales are
dead," recalls the SF resident, a pro-
grammer who previously co-found-
ed the webmail service that would
become Yahoo! mail. "Within a year
or two of the business, you could see
that wasn't true: Even in the digital
era, fans actually want to support
the artists they love. Right now fans
are giving artists $2.8 million every
month [through Bandcamp] . We have
50,000 unique artists communicating
and marketing directly to their fans...
our entire goal is to help artists be
successful. That's really it."

And no, he doesn't want to
name the band whose technical dif-
ficulties inspired the company a few
years back — band members don't
know who they are. And they're not
on Bandcamp yet.

handful of heavy hitters from
the tech and design worlds
asked the question: What
happens when you apply a
business incubator model
- like the well-found-
ed training grounds
that typically nurture
Silicon Valley startups

— to a band? The Zoo Labs Residency,
a two-week, all-expenses-paid pro-
gram for musicians, offers practical
skill-building workshops, marketing
training, mentorship, and studio time
to bands who have a vision but hav-
en't yet achieved a widespread reach.

"We started talking to musicians
about their experiences and how
they were managing their careers
and accomplishing their projects,
and it was really interesting to find
that a lot of musicians and producers
working in music are having very
similar experiences to entrepreneurs
in the startup world," says Anna
Acquistapeace, a designer who found-
ed the program with Vinitha Watson,
an ex-Googler (she opened Google's
first satellite office in India) after the
two met in California College of the
Arts' Design Strategy MBA program.
Music producer Dan Lawrence (who

— full disclosure — I've known since
elementary school, at which time

he wanted to be a music producer)
brought his working knowledge of
the local music industry to the team.
"With all of these changes in the



[music] industry over the last 10 years,
musicians have been forced to take
way more control over their marketing
channels," says Acquistapeace. "They
need to get their own fans, they need
to bootstrap their own products in a
similar to way to what startups do,
whether that means funding albums
or demos to pitch to a record label,
reaching out to the media... they have
to become entrepreneurs, out of neces-
sity. From that, the idea of this artists'
residency-meets-business-incubator or
accelerator was born."

Thus far only one band, an
Americana/roots four-piece called
the Boston Boys, has completed the
residency, participating in a series
of workshops and recording sessions
tailored specifically to their needs:
They took a "sonic branding" class
from Oakland producer Jumbo
(whose credits include work with
Blackalicious, Lyrics Born, and oth-
ers), learned about music law, met
with design professionals and leader-
ship coaches. Meanwhile, recording
engineer/producer Damien Lewis
recorded the band live in the studio
most days in sessions that ran from
2 in the afternoon until 2 in the
morning; the two-week period cul-
minates in a live show at the studio.

In total, the program costs about
$20,000 per session to run, with
much of it being underwritten by
private investors from Silicon Valley
who are simply interested in develop-
ing new models for the music indus-
try. "If there's one thing that people
are passionate across the board, it's
music," says Acquistapeace.' "I haven't
really seen any other art form that
crosses groups the same way."

(The application period for
its March residency just closed,
but look for new programming to
launch in February; the Beat Lab,
which will open next month, aims
to be a combination recording stu-
dio /coworking space for musicians
of all kinds: www.zoolabs.org)

And in, er, music/tech news
of a much lower-tech variety: Tom
Temprano, co-owner of Virgil's Sea
Room in the Mission, announced this
week that the bar, which occupies
the space Nap's III left behind (both
physically and in our hearts), will be
bringing back the grand Nap's tradi-
tion of sloppy, gleeful karaoke around
a glowing screen. Starting Jan. 23,
every Thursday night at 9pm will find
Nap himself back at home base MCing
the action, with songbooks and har-
monicas in tow. Because technology
will march forward — video may have
killed the radio star — but drunken
renditions of Salt 'n' Pepa's "Shoop"?
Karaoke, my friends, is forever, sfbg

hed Out's Ernest Greene
on stepping out from
behind the computer



BY KYLE O'BRIEN

arts@sfbg.com

MUSIC It's been an adventurous
four years for Ernest Greene. In
2009; the musician now known as
Washed Out was producing music
in his childhood bedroom, consid-
ering law school; and planning his
wedding. Perry, Ga., is not widely
known for its indie/electronica
scene, so Greene posted music to
his MySpace page and recorded
it on a few cassette tapes for road
trips. It was a low-key type of thing

— until blogs like Pitchfork started
paying attention.

This is about the time I became
a fan. I was a freshman in college,
brand-new to San Francisco, and
Washed Out sounded like the
future. Most mainstream electronic
production at the time seemed made
for rappers, or was heavily drum-
and-bass influenced. Washed Out
was all '80s influences, hazy and
chilled out. "Retro lo-fi," "dream-
pop," "synth-pop." Chillwave is the
genre most seem to have settled on

— but two EPs, two studio albums,
two international tours, a deal with
SubPop and a Letterman perfor-
mance later, Greene doesn't seem
like he's settling in any other way
anytime soon.

'Tt really took me a couple of
years to figure out my own approach
to live shows, how to make them
happen in a controlled way," says
Greene, 31. He's currently touring
in support of 2013's Paracosm with
a five -piece band (including his
wife, Blair, on synth and vocals) — a
notable departure from his begin-
nings as a bedroom artist with a DJ
setup. He'll bring the show to the



Fillmore Jan. 28 and 29. "There were
a couple of technological break-
throughs I had... where [earlier] some
of the things I was doing in the stu-
dio, I wasn't able to figure out how
to accomplish live."

Coming out from behind the
computer screen has had its chal-
lenges, he says, but he's committed
to creating live music with a band
rather than simply pressing play —
a move that's shifted his focus to
vocal performance.

"In the studio, I could double
my voice 100 times if I wanted to,"
he says. "But if we're on stage and
it's just five of us, by necessity it's
kind of stripped- down, and the live
shows definitely have a different
vibe because of that."

"But harmonies have always
been a pretty important part of
the Washed Out sound," he says.
"When I first started the Washed
Out project, actually, I wasn't really
thinking about singing myself — I
was going to bring in someone else
to sing, and I was just recording
myself as a holding place. I didn't
feel like my voice was very good, so
part of the process was layering a
ton of different vocal takes on top
of each other just to make it sound
better. After a long period of doing
that, it became the sound, and the
music was discovered, and it kind
of took on a life of its own." Most
of the vocals on the new record are
still layered several times over, he
says. Vocals, to Greene, are "just an
instrument in the mix."

A longtime friendship with
electronic artist Toro Y Moi —
Greene and Chaz Bundick went
to high school together — has
also meant a like-minded artist to



bounce ideas off of.

"He's probably the most tal-
ented musician I've ever worked
with — just a super creative guy,"
says Greene. "We were really lucky
that we started getting recognition
around the same time, and eased
into doing this professionally
together... I didn't have any con-
tacts in the music business [start-
ing out], and I remember having
phone calls with him where we
would catch up, [talk over] what we
were going through. I didn't have
that with anyone else."

"His music just keeps getting
better and better," Greene adds.
""Plus all the guys in my band
grew up with the dudes in the Toro
Y Moi band, so it's kind of like a
big family."

The first half of 2014 will see
Washed Out touring nearly non-
stop, including an appearance at
Coachella. He's ready for it. He's
energized by Paracosm, with its
warm, lush instrumentation, its
constructed sense of escapism —
the album's title itself refers to the
concept of a fantasy world. That
correlates heavily with the newer
record's vibrant visual art, he says,
as opposed to the stark white
design of 201 1's Within & Without.

"This newer stuff is a lot more
vibrant-feeling, so the colors seem
to suit it well," he says. "It's all
about the music. That will lead the
way most of the time." sfbg

SUPER EGO Can we give it up for at
least six months of no new hyped-up
microgenre of dance music hitting
us over the heads? I feel adrift in a
vortex of diverse styles, vibing to
deep individuality. I mean, I adore
— and, in the increasingly global-
ized scene, fear for — the future of
killer regional sounds, from Chicago
footwork and Berlin post-minimal
to UK bass and Ibiza tech house.
Let's hope scenes and schools still
gather around and amplify organic
sounds on local streets and in local
bedrooms. It certainly makes dance
music easier to write about. But there
seems to be a sigh of relief ema-
nating from the turntables lately, a
sense of anything good goes. Enjoy
it before the next possibly question-
able trend takes hold!

MICHAEL
SHOWALTER

COURTESY OF
SFSKETCHFEST



A comedian cursed

Michael Showalter defends dinner, under duress



BY EMMA SILVERS

esilvers@sfbg.com

THEATER For those of us who've been
following Michael Showalter since he
was but a flop-haired 20-something
on MTV's The State — where he gave
us, among other absurdist treasures,
Doug, a rebellious teenager whose cool
dad gave him frustratingly little to
rebel against — there is no Showalter
project too silly, too cranky, too
obscure to love. Whether it was Stella,
Michael and Michael Have Issues, or,
say the training montage from Wet
Hot American Summer that burrowed
its way weirdly into your heart, there's
something about the comedian that's
eminently endearingly watchable.

Ahead of his appearances Jan. 31
and Feb. 1 at SF Sketchfest, we caught
up with Showalter as he took a break
in the writers' room of the Rebel
Wilson TV show Super Fun Night (he's
a producer) to talk cats, comedy, and
what makes him feel like a loser.

San Francisco Bay Guardian You have
several projects going on right now, but
the first thing I need to ask about is a
male-centric cat ownership guidebook you
published last October: Guys Can Be Cat
Ladies Too. How many cats do you have?
Michael Showalter Right now I'm liv-
ing in LA, and we have four indoor
cats here. And then at our place in
Brooklyn, there's a small posse of cats
that live in my backyard, that are
now being taken care of by the peo-
ple subletting our place. At any given
moment there are between three and
six cats back there... so using the law
of averages, I'll say I have seven.

SFBG Why did the world need a hook
about how to he a male cat lady?
MS Basically, I really took to heart
the saying "Write what you know."
I looked around me and said "What
do you know?" As I was saying that
I probably had two cats on my lap.
My next book is going to be about
drinking coffee.

SFBG Since it's premiering at Sundance
this week, what can you tell us about
They Came Together (in theaters Jan.
24), the Paul Rudd-Amy Poehler rom-
com you made with your usual partner-
in-crime David Wain? Do you think it
will appease the hordes of Wet Hot
American Summer fans who are



hungry for a sequel — or prequel, as
has been discussed?
MS I'd say it's a parody/homage to the
romantic comedies of the '80s and
'90s that myself and David Wain sort
of grew up on and loved. It's a com-
bination send-up/love letter, based in
New York. Obviously it's got a great
cast... and yeah, it's very similar in a
lot of ways [to Wet Hot]. It has a lot
of the same sensibility to it, the refer-
ence points, the sense of humor.

SFBG Because I have to ask anyway: Is
there still a Wet Hot prequel in the works?
MS Yeah. We're figuring it out. But
I've been instructed by David Wain
not to talk about it, because we want
it to be shrouded in mystery. Like
the new Star Wars movie.

SFBG Fair. Shall we talk about your
podcast with Michael Ian Black? How
is that kind of writing different from
screenwriting or, say, cat books?
MS Topics! Topics is actually all
improvised. Basically the two of us
are in character as two guys who
take themselves very seriously and
think very highly of their own opin-
ions. The main thing with Topics is
we try not to tell jokes — we're just
being these characters who are real-
ly, really serious about what they're
talking about, but they don't actual-
ly know anything. We just start out
with a topic and we improvise for
half an hour. [Ed. note — December
brought us such topics as ''Regret,"
''The Middle East," and "Paranormal
Activity." It's excellent]

SFBG There are some of us for whom
The State is still the gold standard in
sketch comedy. Do you think it would
work on TV right now? There hasn't
really been anything like it since.
MS You know, I think we were very
much a product of
our generation.
It was Kids in
the Hall and
The State and
the Upright
Citizens

Brigade. . . and I ^^^^^k.

think at that
time.




sketch comedy was still a kind
of theatrical thing, it hadn't yet
become so video-based. I don't know
if sketch in that traditional sense is
still as viable. But I'm sure another
great sketch show will come along,
figure out the next thing.

SFBG ^5 for Sketchfest— of the
events you're scheduled to perform in,
I'm most excited about the Uptown
Showdown debate on breakfast vs. din-
ner. Can you say what side you're on?
MS (Sighs deeply.) OK, which do you
think will win, should win?

SFBG I would say breakfast, hands down.
MS Yeah. So 1 am on dinner. I did not
choose to be on dinner; dinner was
given to me. Here's the thing: This
will be my fourth time competing in
Uptown Showdown. The first time
was cats vs. dogs. I was on cats, and
we lost to dogs. The second time was
Christmas vs. Hanukkah. I was on
Christmas, and we lost to Hanukkah.
The third time, last year, we did the
'80s vs. the '90s, and I was on the '80s,
and we lost to the '90s. So this year —
dinner vs. breakfast — I already know
I'm going to lose, and I'm livid about it.

I'm not even joking. I could
read you my emails back and forth
with [the organizers] where they're
asking me to do this and I'm saying
I don't like it — here, I'll pull it up.
I wrote, 'T'm sick and tired of losing
at this." I'm not being facetious. It's
making me feel bad about myself.
Like a loser. It really pisses me off.

SFBG How did this happen, exactly?
Who gets to choose?
MS Here, let me find this email. . .
"David Wain prefers that his team
defend breakfast as the superior
meal." Sure. What's the point? I
know we'll lose. I have the Uptown
Showdown curse.



SFBG You sound pretty defeatist
about this. Are you even going to
prepare?

MS Oh, yeah. I mean, don't
get me wrong. When it's game
time, I'll come to do battle, sfbg

PORO OYNA SHARES A HEROIC TALE FROM A DISAPPEARING
CULTURE IN NORTHERN JAPAN, photos bytakahiro kohara




In light and shadow

Spiritual redemption and hard truths nningle in the West Coast prenniere of 'Poro Oyna'



BY ROBERT AVILA

arts@sfbg.com

THEATER Last week's performance
of the shadow play Pom Oyna: The
Myth of the Aynu, at Fort Mason's
Southside Theater, began with a
blessing in disguise.

As members of the cast and
of the Aynu community gathered
onstage ahead of the performance,
four Aynu men in black shirts and
traditional headbands and neck-
laces prepared to sing and dance.
As the elder of the four explained,
shadow master Larry Reed, founder
and longtime artistic director of
Shadowlight Productions, had asked
if the Aynu folks in attendance
could offer a short blessing to start
things off.

'T didn't have a chance to tell
Larry, we don't do blessings," con-
fessed the man. "But we welcome
people. And this is one of our most
sacred dance stories; it's about fami-
ly," he explained, adding that, with
it, "we welcome you to our part of
the world."

So began a rare, gently moving,
and altogether charming encoun-
ter three years in the making.
Co -produced by Shadowlight and
Tokyo -based shadow theater compa-
ny Urotsutenoyako Bayangans, Poro
Oyna: The Myth of the Aynu brought
together traditional Aynu artists
and musicians with masters of the
shadow theater form in the US and
Japan to share a mythological world
at once distinctive and not so far
from our own.

Adapted by OKI and Koyano
Tetsuro, and directed by Larry Reed
(the Bay Area's master of a unique
and potently cinematic style of
modern shadow theater), the Aynu
creation myth came to life on a
stage and screen populated by a
revolving and enrapturing set of



images and figures. Some were
drawn, some were embodied by
actors in masks, some walked out
before the screen onto the darkened
lip of the stage, like living, breath-
ing, three-dimensional shadows.
And just as the imagery contained a
surprising set of rich hues amid its
black-and-white scheme, the English
narration came generously colored
with snatches of Japanese and Aynu.

Heavy in the mix was a trans-
porting score created by a wonder-
ful pairing of masterful musicians.
Accomplished musician and record-
ing artist OKI (who, in addition to
adapting the story, also oversaw the
art direction) provided live accom-
paniment on a pair of tonkori, the
traditional plucked stringed instru-
ment of the Aynu people, as well as
offering the first springing, playful
tones of the night on a mukkuri (a
wooden mouth harp). Meanwhile,
in entrancing, syncopated rhythms,
the four members of the female
vocal group Marewrew channeled
the traditional Aynu musical form
of upopo.

The Aynu (also spelled Ainu) are
a small community of people living
in Hokaiddo, Japan's northern and
second largest island. Indigenous to
this area of northern Japan as well
as to nearby Russia, the Aynu have
a culture that stretches back more
than 3,000 years. Having faced
centuries of oppression, including
forced assimilation, their culture
remains little known even inside
Japan, and their language (which
has no written form) is at risk of dis-
appearing entirely, with fewer than
15 native speakers left alive.

A large proportion of these were
on hand in the creation and deliv-
ery of Poro Oyna. The title, which
means "the great story," refers to
the hero's journey of Aynu Rakkur,
the most powerful of all the gods.



He is also a god who "smells like a
human being," born (as we see in
the opening scene) from the incen-
diary coupling of his father, the
god of thunder, and his mother, a
great elm tree. Indeed, Aynu Rakkur
is considered the progenitor of the
human race.

In ensemble member
Kawamura Koheisai's impressive
Balinese-inspired shadow designs,
Aynu Rakkur's shadow self is a
black and white portrait of grace
and resolve, a noble profile pro-
truding from a finely drawn lat-
ticework of hair. He's tough, goes
his own way, and has a sly sense of
humor. He lives beside Kaikaiunt,
a sacred lake and the source of all
life. One day a growling, cockeyed
monster with a fearsome under bite
and an unpronounceable name
(rattled off in a long string of Aynu
sibilants actually delighting to the
ear) steals the Sun Goddess and
plunges the world into darkness
and a perpetual sleep from which
many humans never awake.

As other lesser gods try and fail
to wrest the sun from the clutches
of the monster, Aynu Rakkur bides
his time, doggedly carving away at
something that turns out to be "a
bear for a flat screen TV." Finally
taking umbrage at finding his front
door pinned down with arrows and
spears, he seeks out the monster and
the two of them tumble deep down
into the Underworld, where they
battle for some six years.

The happy ending might have
been expected, but it came, under
the circumstances, with what felt
too like an auspicious beginning.

"The people come back, the sun
returns," rejoices the narrator, "our
sacred power is getting stronger
every day." sfbg

Dance Brigade's
Hemorrhage takes on
SF's identity crisis



BY RITA FELCIANO

arts@sfbg.com

DANCE Sitting at her large desk over-
looking the intersection of Mission
and 24th Street, Krissy Keefer speaks
eloquently and movingly about the
genesis of Hemorrhage: An Ablution
of Hope and Despair, the latest work
for her 10 -woman Dance Brigade
Company.

Keefer is a dancer-choreogra-
pher-activist who has always enthu-
siastically plowed into the morass of
the social, environmental, and polit-
ical concerns of the day. Her works
are issue- oriented, theatrically savvy,
and entertaining, not least because
of her sense of humor. Keefer may be
deadly serious about her art, but she
doesn't take herself all that seriously.

But on a recent Saturday after-
noon, as her crew prepared the main
theater for a rehearsal of Hemorrhage,
you couldn't help but notice a note
of fatigue, even despair, in her pas-
sionate takedown of the types of
disasters that drain us of our human-
ity with ever-increasing frequency.

Keefer admits to being a news
junkie. She has her ear to the
ground, not just locally; she's in tune
with Midwest farmers who can't
plant crops because of the drought,
multi-millionaire Chinese who leave
their fellow citizens behind, and
the survivors of Fukushima and
Hurricane Sandy. Where are they,
she wonders, how do people survive?
''If you pay attention, you live with
hope and despair. You obsess with
hope, but what you feel underneath
is actually despair. If you are not
feeling some kind of despair, you are
not paying attention."

But couldn't the increased flood
of disaster information be the result
of our sensationalist 24/7 news
cycle? She doesn't think so, believ-
ing instead that violent upheavals
have actually become more frequent:
''What we have done to



the environment, [for instance] , is
completely despairing." Included in
her indictment are not only the gov-
ernmental, corporate, and financial
forces that act out of self-interest, but
also a progressive movement that she
believes has not acted strongly and
decisively enough.

But Keefer 's major preoccupation
at the moment is what she calls the
"the corporate monsters — the last
robber barons," who are destroying
a culture she has helped build. She
lives and works in the Mission, and
raised her daughter there. In the
last 12 years. Dance Mission Theater
has become a community institu-
tion, offering classes for adults and
children, and providing affordable
rehearsal and performance space.
These days, when she looks through
her office window and sees all those
Silicon Valley-bound buses swarming
past, she wants to pull out her hair.

"I feel very protective of the
culture that we have created in San
Francisco. You put layer upon layer
on it, from the longshoremen, the
Beat poets, the Black Panthers, the
hippies, the gay and lesbian solidar-
ity movement, feminism, the immi-
grant communities. It's like layers
of cheesecloth that you lay down,
and this is the culture that came
out of it. I participated in that, I am
dedicated to it, and I am devastated
by its being pulled apart." Mincing
no words, she adds, "It's one of the
cultures that keeps our country from
sliding into fascism."

So Keefer is stepping into the
trenches as she always has done: as
an artist. Walking into the theater,
you realize this is the messiest set she
(with Kate Boyd) has ever created. It's
one big junk pile, taking over half
the theater and filling the bleachers
from top to bottom. It makes you
think of the outskirts of Mumbai
and Manila, where thousands of
people try to eke



a living from whatever they can
salvage. Where did Dance Brigade
get the wheel drums, broken crock
pots, fans, at least one bathtub, lace
curtains, suitcases, Christmas tree
ornaments, and enough body parts
to reassemble several automobiles?

"We went to a wrecking yard,"
Keefer laughs. "They deliver."

Thinking of herself and her
dancers as having been exiled
from their city, as so many people
have recently been, she envisioned
Hemorrhage as a work about having
to live on the edges. "Women always
are more vulnerable during catastro-
phes," she says, "because they take
care of the children."

For the script, she drew on
her own writing but also that of
fellow San Franciscans Rebecca
Solnit (Hollow City: The Siege of San
Francisco and the Crisis of American
Urbanism) and performer-activist
Guillermo Gomez-Pena, shaping it
as a running monologue — a rant, a
poem, a meditation, a political man-
ifesto — that runs through the piece
and ties it together.

And what do her nine women
performers, most of whom have been
part of Dance Brigade for close to 20
years, contribute? They sing, they
shout, they play the drums, they
dance; fiercely, proudly, unstoppably,
full of hope, and full of despair, sfbg

expert physical comedy and charm that made
long-running hits of Reed's last two solo shows.
East 14th and The Kipling Hotel (both

You Dig It? reaches, forthe most part, into
the "early" earlyyears, Reed'sgrammar-school

Archetypal tales, vibrant
cinematic voices reign at
the African Filnn Festival

BY CHERYL EDDY

cheryl@sfbg.com

FILM This week, the African Film
Festival National Traveling Series
touches down at the Pacific Film
Archive, bearing seven features and
a number of shorts. The only film
to have previous local distribution is
Andrew Dosunmu's Mother of George,
about a Nigerian couple living in
Brooklyn whose marriage is tested
when the wife — played by Walking
Dead badass Danai Gurira; her hus-
band is Jim Jarmusch muse Isaach De
Bankole — fails to become pregnant
with the son her in-laws demand.
The gorgeous photography earned
Bradford Young (who also lensed
AM Them Bodies Saints) a cinema-
tography prize at last year's Sundance
Film Festival, and, appealing cast
aside, his work is the main reason to
catch George on the big screen.

The strongest film in the festival
is the one that closes it: David Tosh
Gitonga's crime drama Nairobi Half
Life, submitted by Kenya as its first
Best Foreign Language Film contend-
er last year. Though it didn't make
the Oscar shortlist (frankly, it was
a tough year for foreign films, with
Amour claiming all major accolades),
it's easy to see why it made the cut.
It's the not-unfamiliar tale of a rural
dreamer named Mwas (the charismat-
ic Joseph Wairimu) who sets out to



pursue an acting career in the big city
(''where the devil lives," according to
his mother). His improv skills are on
point, but he is completely gullible,
which makes him a prime target as
soon as he arrives in "Nairobbery."

Urban life offers many hard les-
sons, whether it's Mwas finding his
place in the gang he joins as a means
of survival, or overcoming the
snooty dismissals of the professional
actors he enounters at theatrical
auditions. In both realms, he gets in
over his head, but he's a quick think-
er and a talented hustler, which gives
him an edge his opponents tend to
underestimate. If Nairobi Half Life's
script leans a little heavily on Mwas
being caught between two worlds
(alternate title suggestion: Nairobi
Double Life), its energy is infectious
and its presentation is polished
— props to producer Tom Twyker
(1998's Run Lola Run, 2012's Cloud
Atlas), whose One Fine Day Film
Workshop guided its making.

Director Lonesome Solo's more
rough-hewn and downbeat Burn It Up
Djassa also weaves a tale of despera-
tion that culminates in violence, this
time in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's
largest metropolis. Again, there's a
conflicted young man at its center:
Tony, or ''Dabagaou" (as he's known
in the 'hood), whose rise from cig-
arette seller to killer on the run is
shared via a streetwise narrator who
lays down story beats like a hip-hop
version of Shakespeare; his scenes are
the most cinematic amid what feels
like an otherwise largely improvised
effort. And indeed. Burn It Up Djassa

builds to a tragedy of Bardian pro-
portions. You'll see it coming, but it's
wrenching nonetheless.

Death is the main character
in Alain Gomis' Dakar-set Tey, or
''today," which takes place in a world
that resembles ours but with one key
supernatural difference: Those who
are about to die are given 24 -hour
advance notice. One morning, seem-
ingly healthy fortysomething Satche
wakes up with the grim knowledge
that this is his last day. By the same
mysterious power, those closest to
him — his family, friends, a bitter for-
mer lover, and his wife (though not, it
seems, his young children) — are also
made aware. Though there's a certain
amount of wailing from his older rel-
atives, Satche accepts his fate, drifting
through a day that begins with a sort
of living funeral, in which both praise
and criticism are lobbed at him, and
leads into a raucous street parade and
hang time with friends.

As the day grows longer, it turns
more melancholy; he visits the man
who'll be preparing his corpse for
burial, who reminds Satche he's lucky
to know when his time is up so he has
a chance to say his good-byes. But Tey
isn't a total bummer of a movie — it
has a dreamy quality and moments of
humor, as when Satche shows up late
to a ceremony held in his honor, but
can't find anything to eat or drink at
the completely pillaged catering table.
That this dead man walking is played



by American slam poet Saul Williams
(though Satche is Senegalese) adds to
his inherent outsider vibe. The ticking
clock breaks down any forced polite-
ness in his encounters, particularly
with his wife, which gives us an idea
of what he like was before he knew he
was about to die.

End-of-life issues also domi-
nate Akosua Adoma Owusu's Kwaku
Ananse, one of three films composing
"Between Cultures: Recent African
Shorts" (the other two, Taisal Goes
West and the Quvenzhane Wallis-
starring Boneshaker, were not available
for preview; among the features,
Damien Ounouri's documentary
Tida'i, a portrait of his Algerian free-
dom-fighting great uncle, was also
unfortunately unavailable). Kwaku
Ananse casts the West African trick-
ster character, Anansi (Americans
know him from classic children's
book Anansi the Spider: A Tale from the
Ashanti), as its main character's recent-
ly deceased father. The young woman
has come to his Ghanan village for his
funeral, and to confront the second
family he was keeping on the side.
The 25 -minute work slowly becomes
more fairy tale-like as it progresses,
anchored by a solemn but fiery perfor-
mance by lovely star Jojo Abot.

Elsewhere in the fest, a mocku-
mentary from Cameroon (banned
in Cameroon, not coincidentally)
about what would happen if the
president suddenly disappeared (Le
President) is paired with short Nigerian
doc Puelling Poverty; both examine
deep-seated corruption in troubled,
post-colonial economies. And for a



completely different audience (ages 7
and up) is Remi Bezan^on and Jean-
Christophe Lie's Zarafa, the animated
story of a young boy who escapes slav-
ery in Africa and becomes enmeshed
in the remarkable, mostly true story
of the first giraffe to take up residence
in France, sfbg

it's good news that the latest annual
edition of SF-bred Noir City at the
Castro Theatre — kicking off Fri/24 —
expands its programming to the sep-
arate-but-equal terrain of 1940s and
'50s crime melodramas made outside
the genre's traditional home. Dubbed
"It's a Bitter Little World/' Noir City
12 has a smattering of Hollywood
titleS; but otherwise for the first time
ranges far afield, hauling in tough
dramas from places like England,
Argentina, Germany and Japan.

The somber post-war mood that
spurred noir cinema was, in the US,
fomented largely by the trauma and
disillusionment suffered by both
returning vets and those they came
back to. But in many other nations,
the damage was more than personal
and psychological — people returned
to cities reduced to rubble after
years of fighting, surviving residents
already accustomed to extreme depri-
vation. Plus, former allies and enemy
combatants alike were now regarded
with suspicion as they lingered at
the war's end to oversee "reconstruc-
tion," the language and cultural gaps
and unfamiliar new lines of author-
ity in turn breeding new avenues of
corruption and resistance.

Two films most directly deal-
ing with that atmosphere are
double-billed Mon/27. Made in
1946 (though it wasn't released in
some parts of divided, occupied
Germany until some time later).
The Murderers Are Among Us was the
first of the "triimmerfilm," literally
"rubble film" — movies portraying
Germans' struggles with recupera-
tion and loss in the wake of humili-
ating defeat, not to mention the rev-
elations of heinous Nazi war crimes.
Returning home from a concen-
tration camp, Susanne (Hildegard
Knef) finds her Berlin apartment
already occupied by Hans (Wilhelm
Borchert), an embittered, alcoholic
physician who no longer practices.

Forced to uneasily cohabit, they
try to re-establish some semblance
of ordinary life, though that effort
is imperiled when former military 
doctor Hans discovers the superior
officer he'd thought dead is in fact
alive, well, and prospering — suffer-
ing no consequences at all for order-
ing the massacre of a hundred Polish
civilians, including women and chil-
dren. (Purportedly, occupying Soviet
authorities insisted on changing the
film's intended ending, fearing that
if Hans actually assassinated the
officer, viewers would be tempted
toward vigilante justice themselves.)

Duly shot amid a city in ruins.
Murderers remains potent stuff, even



if it soft-pedals certain aspects: For
instance, concentration camp survivor
Susanne is as Aryan as can be, the sub-
ject of a Jewish Holocaust apparently
still being too touchy to mention.
Knef (who actually had spent time in
a prison camp) became an immediate
star, a refreshingly unconventional
one who spurned Hollywood offers
and shrugged off outrage over a nude
sequence (in 1950's The Sinner) with
the memorable observation that such
"tumult" was ridiculous coming "five
years after Auschwitz!"

Its 1948 co-feature Berlin Express,
directed by Jacques Tourneur (of
1942's Cat People and other horror
classics) was a Hollywood production
shot on location in Europe, with a
multinational cast playing various
figures traveling on a train from Paris
to the German capital. When one
who'd been an important German
anti-Nazi resistance figure is killed
en route, lingering wartime animos-
ities are overcome to solve the crime
— the tentative friendships among
them a simple metaphor for the coop-
eration required among nations to
rebuild after catastrophic conflict.

Less politically tilted, but also
dealing with a devastated, immedi-
ately-postwar landscape, are Akira
Kurosawa's first two collaborations
with dynamic star Toshiro Mifune,
screening Sun/26. Mifune plays a seri-
ously ill crook in 1948's Drunken Angel,
then crosses over to play a no -less-
edgy junior member of the police
force in the following year's Stray Dog.
His protagonist in that film is morti-
fied when the revolver he's issued is
stolen on a tram, then used to commit
a series of crimes. His obsessive pursuit
of the weapon takes him deep into a
remarkably seedy makeshift Tokyo of
shanty towns, prostitution, and black
markets, everyone flop-sweating amid
oppressive summer heat.

Other films examine more ordi-
nary, already-entrenched corrup-
tion in post-war power structures:
Spanish Death of a Cyclist (1955)
and Norwegian Death is a Caress
(1949) find members of the social
elite going to murderous lengths to
hide their infidelities; two excellent
British dramas from 1947, It Always
Rains on Sunday and the Graham
Greene-derived Brighton Rock, are
bleak slices of lower-class lives
driven to crime and desperation;
florid Mexican melodrama Victims
of Sin (1951) puts its glamorous her-
oine (blond Cuban Ninon Sevilla)
through a mill of sexual hypocrisies
and hot "African" dance numbers.

Noir City 12's US titles, aptly,
focus mostly on international crimi-
nal and romantic intrigue: Anthony
Mann's 1949 Border Incident involves
Mexican immigrant-worker exploita-

OPENING

G.B.F. High schooler Brent (Paul lacono)
decides his path to social success will be estab-
lished once hecomesout. I mean, duh — he'll
becomethe pet pickofthe would-be prom
queens: the girl-with-the-best-hair Fawcett
(Sasha Pieterse), drama mama Caprice (Xosha
Roquemore), and Mormon good girl 'Shiey
(Andrea Bowen), and mad popularity will ensue.
Alas, wholly unprepared comic-book fan Tanner
(Michel J. Willet) gets outed first — and the
battle fortheO.G. G.B.F. (or "gay best friend")
is on. Working with a fast, sassy, and slangy
script — and teen comedy vets Natasha Lyonne,
Rebecca Gayheart, and Jonathan Silverman —
director Darren Stein (1999's Jawbreaker) has
already traversed some of this uber-camp terri-
tory; yes, there's a multiplayersaunter down a
high school hall and a major makeover montage.
Butthesnappy, laugh-out-loud dialogue by first-
time screenwriter George Northy (fresh from the
OutfestScreenwriting Lab), alongwith some
high-speed improvising by the cast, makes for
an effortlessly enjoyable viewing experience.
(1:38) Metreon. (Chun)
Gimme Shelter Vanessa Hudgens plays a preg-
nant, homeless 16-year-old in this based-on-
true events tale. (1:40) Shattuck.
I, Frankenstein Cobbled-togethersuperhuman
Adam Frankenstein (Aaron Eckhart) enters the
fray when a war between gargoyles and demons
breaks out. Needless to say this is based on a
graphic novel (by screenwriter and actor Kevin
Greviouxof the Underworld series). (1:33)
The Last Match Yosvani (Milton Garcia) and
Reinier (Reinier Diaz) are barely adult, unem-
ployed Havana residents on the margins, each
livingunderagirlfriend orwife's roof, but more
properly living underthethumb of that partner's
parent. While Yosvani has it somewhat easy in
the household of black marketeer Silvano (Luis
Alberto Garcia), Reinier has to peddle his body
to tourists — for a while snagging a good one

in visiting Spaniard Juan (Toni Canto) — to get
by. There's a simmering attraction between the
two ostensibly heterosexual best friends that
won't make life any easier — and even when
talented player Rey gets scouted by soccer pros,
his potential good fortune could be undone by
a debt owed to Silvano, who is not to be fooled
with. This leisurely but compelling drama, a
Spanish-Cuban co-production by director-cow-
riter Antonio Hens (2007's Clandestinos)
mixes a restrained love story (there's some nudi-
ty but not much hot-guys-making-out titillation
here) with observation of Cuban social norms re:
macho vs. "down low" life, money (orthe lackof
it), and so forth. It's not wildly original in content
or style, but there's an air of unassuming truth
that makes the eventual turn toward tragedy feel
more resonantthan formulaic. (1:34) Opera
Plaza. (Harvey)



ONGOING

Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit Throwback
Terror Thursday, anyone? If the early Bourne
entries leapt ahead of then-current surveil-
lance technology in their paranoia-inducing
abilityto Find-Replace-Eliminate international
villains wherever they were in the world, then
Jack Ryan: Shadow /?ec/'iv/Yflails in the
opposite direction — toward a nonsensical,
flag-waving mixture of Cold War and War on
Terror phobias. So when covert mucky-muck
Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) solemnly
warns that if mild-mannered former Marine and
secret CIA analyst Jack Ryan stumbles, the US
is in dangerof ... anotherGreat Depression,
you just have to blink, Malcolm Gladwell-
style. Um, didn't we just do that? And is this
movie out of touch? It doesn't helpthat



director Kenneth Branagh casts himself as the
sleek, camp, and illin' Russian baddie Viktor
Cherevin, who'sstyled like a '90sclubtsar in
formfitting black clothing with a sheen that
screams "Can this dance-floorsadist buyyou
another cosmo?" He's intended to pass for
something resembling sex — and soul — in
Shadow Recruit's odd, determinedly clue-
less universe. That leaves a colorless, blank
Chris Pinewith thethanklesstaskof rescuing
whiney physician love Cathy (Keira Knightley)
from baddie clutches. Pine's no Alec Baldwin,
lackingthe latter'swit and anger management
issues, or even Ben Affleck, who has also
succumbed to blank, beefcake posturingon
occasion. Let's return this franchise to its box,
firmly relegated to the shadows. (1:45) Marina,
Metreon, 1000 Van Ness. (Chun)
Ride Along Bysheerdintof hisabilityto push
his verbosity and non-threatening physicality
into that nerd zone between smartand clue-
less, intelligent and irritating, Kevin Hart may
be poised to become Hollywood's new comedy
MVP. In the case of Ride Along, it helps that
Ice Cube has comictalents, too — proven in the
Fjr/c/aymoviesaswell as in 2012's 21 Jump
Street— asthe straight man who can actually
scowl and smile atthe same time. Together,
in Ride /l/ong', they bring the featherweight
pleasures of Rush Hour-style odd-couple
chortles. Hart is Ben, a gamergeekand school
security guard shootingto becomethe most
wrinkly studentatthe police academy. He
looks up to hardened, street-smart cop James
(Cube), brother of his new fiancee, Angela (Tika
Sumpter). Naturally, instead of simply blessing
the nuptials, the tough guy decides to haze
the shut-in, disabusing him of any illusions
he might have of being his equal. More-than-
equal talents like Laurence Fishburne and
John Leguizamo are pretty much wasted here
— apart from Fishburne's ultra lite impression
of Matrix man Morpheus — but if you don't
expect much more than the chuckles eked out
of Ride Along's commercials, you won't be too
disappointed by this nontaxingjourney. (1:40)
Metreon, 1000 Van Ness. (Chun) sfbg
