During a trading simulation in a graduate investment class at Boston
University in 2014, the winning strategy used a straddle close to the
release date of the 10-K of a certain public company. Such performance
raised the question of using a systematic investment in blue chip
straddles close to the companyies' financial statement release as a
potential strategy in which the returns would be above average. It is
currently known that many fund managers use such strategy as part of
their strategies' portfolio. However, since they use additional criteria
to decide which company stocks should they straddle. So far, no found
literature studied the expected returns of taking a systematic
investment approach of creating straddles on the most negotiated public
companies, the so called Blue Chips.\\
 The approach of measuring the returns invoves collecting stock prices
from Blue Chip companies and comparing their price variation close to
the release data of Quarterly and Yearly financial to their average
price variation. If the hypothesis that the two sets (variation close to
the release date and at a random date) is rejected, a simulation will be
ran on past data to see if a systematic approach could yield returns
greater than the passive index average, which could provide a
complementary strategy to the passive index investment.\\
 The data is going to collected from public available sources as it
could be easily replicated by others. The methodology is still being
defined based on the availability and quality of data.
